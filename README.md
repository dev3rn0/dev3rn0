- 👋 Hi, I’m @dev3rn0
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Recruitment and Project Management
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, MySQL, Git and Microservices. I'm aiming for MERN-stack to begin with.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects aiming to help those in need

I started learning web development in early 2021 and it seems to have become something I would like to do for a living in one way or another.
